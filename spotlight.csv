Junshu Wang-0,"​​​​​​Junshu Wang is a senior double majoring in psychology and East Asian languages and cultures, and has been an intern for ATLAS since the Summer of 2017. The reason Junshu was interested in becoming an ATLAS intern was because he was looking for an experience that connected with his majors, providing opportunities for him to learn something new and giving him applied experience in interdisciplinary research that can be applied to his future career as a researcher in a social psychology-related field. Currently, he is working on a Qualtrics survey with a focus group about the usability of Moodle for students and faculty who use essays and heat maps; thisfeedback will be forwarded to ATLAS programmers working on a Moodle app. Junshu also believes that “less is more” when it comes to programs and, as such, they shouldn’t have “a maze of features hidden in menus or tiny buttons.” His project will help prevent the Moodle app from having this kind of issue. So far, one of the significant things Junshu has learned is how to design websites around accessibility principles. When not at his internship, Junshu bikes, reads, or engages in volunteering with BikeFace, the Office of Volunteer Programs, and the Stern Lab."
